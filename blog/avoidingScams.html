    	<p>Unfortunately, moving scams are far from uncommon. What's not unfortunate is that all these scam artists operate in basically the same way, making them easy to identify. Here are some obvious red flags to watch out for when choosing a moving company and tips to help you avoid scams:</p>
    	<h2 class="blogHead">Low Prices</h2>
    	<p>These guys often quote low prices. If your 2 bedroom apartment is estimated at $300 to relocate, it's possible you're dealing with a con artist. What you thought was a great deal can quickly end up costing you 10 times what you where initially quoted. Labor costs are inflated and various fees are hidden in the contract for stairs, heavy items, narrow alleyways and mandatory insurance fees, which brings us to tip number 2.</p>
    	<h2 class="blogHead">Understand Your Contract</h2>
    	<p>If you look closely at your contract you may notice that the $40/hr labour charge is actually per mover and that $35 stair fee is per mover, per staircase. I've heard of people being charged per individual stair. If you don't fully understand your contract you could find yourself in a situation where your belongings are being held hostage; a common "negotiation technique" for scam artists.</p>
    	<h2 class="blogHead">Get an Estimate</h2>
    	<p>It's your right as a consumer to request an estimate in writing before signing a contract. Once the contract is in place, by law, a moving company cannot charge more that 10% above the estimate. For more information on your rights as a consumer you can visit the <a class="blogLink" href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/hiring-mover#section-2">Ontario website</a>.</p>
    	<p>The best defense against a scam is information so if you'd like to know more about how to protect yourself on moving day or about <a class="blogLink" href="../index.html#rates">Our Rates</a>, give us a call at <a class="blogLink" href="tel:+1-647-671-5155">1 (647) 671-5155</a></p>
